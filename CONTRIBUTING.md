## 🧱 Branching Model

Use the following structure:

* **main** → production
* **dev** → integration branch
* **feat/<feature-name>** → new features
* **fix/<bug-name>** → bug fixes
* **docs/<section>** → documentation updates
* **refactor/<area>** → code refactoring

Example:

```
git checkout -b feat/ai-intent-engine
```

---

## 📝 Commit Convention

Follow **Conventional Commits**:

```
feat: add new AI intent mapping engine
fix: handle crash when generating schedule
docs: update API reference
refactor: simplify auth flow
chore: update dependencies
```

---

## 📦 Pull Request Guidelines

A good PR includes:

* A clear title and description
* Linked issue or context
* Small, focused changes
* Passing tests
* Updated documentation (if needed)

Before submitting, ensure:

```
npm run lint
npm run test
```

---

## 🧩 Coding Standards

* Follow the TypeScript style guide
* Use ESLint and Prettier (preconfigured)
* Keep functions small and purposeful
* Always type your input/output
* Avoid magic strings — use enums or constants

---

## 🧪 Testing

We use:

* **Pytest** for FastAPI backend

Write tests for:

* Core logic
* AI intent routing
* API endpoints

---

## 🤖 AI Feature Development Rules

When modifying the AI:

* Do not change base system prompts without discussion
* Document new intents in `/apps/ai/intents` directory
* Ensure new flows are logged for transparency
* Test manually in the sandbox chat environment

---

## 📘 Documentation

All documentation lives in the `/docs` folder.
When changing:

* API → update `/docs/architecture/backend.md`
* AI → update `/docs/architecture/ai.md`
* Architecture → update `/docs/architecture/`

---

## 💡 Requesting New Features

Create an issue containing:

* Problem statement
* Why it matters
* Proposed solution
* (Optional) UI sketches

---

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

Include:
